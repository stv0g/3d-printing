## Antenna connectors

This mount includes two holes at the bottom which align with the TS9 antenna connectors.

I recommend to use TS9 to SMA adapters which can be screwed into those holes

## Foam padding

The inside of the mount has a clearance of about 1,5mm against each side which can be used for padding the device with foam rubber.
